No, the script itself doesn't run for 60 minutes continuously. Instead, it schedules a task to revert the changes after 60 minutes using the `threading.Timer` method. The script runs, performs the updates, and then exits. The scheduled task will be executed 60 minutes later by the `threading.Timer` mechanism.

If you need the script to keep running or to handle multiple updates and reverts dynamically, you may want to implement a more robust solution that involves a loop or a scheduler. Below is an improved version that uses a loop to continuously check and apply the updates and revert them as needed:

```python
import boto3
import json
import time
import threading

def update_table_capacity(table_name, read_capacity, write_capacity):
    try:
        # Initialize the DynamoDB client
        dynamodb = boto3.client("dynamodb", region_name="us-east-1")
        # Update the table's provisioned throughput
        dynamodb.update_table(
            TableName=table_name,
            ProvisionedThroughput={
                'ReadCapacityUnits': read_capacity,
                'WriteCapacityUnits': write_capacity
            }
        )
        # Wait until the table is updated
        waiter = dynamodb.get_waiter('table_exists')
        waiter.wait(TableName=table_name)
        print(f"Table '{table_name}' provisioned capacity updated successfully.")
        print(f"New Read Capacity: {read_capacity}")
        print(f"New Write Capacity: {write_capacity}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error updating table capacity '{table_name}': {e}")

def update_scaling_policies(table_name, min_read_capacity, max_read_capacity, min_write_capacity, max_write_capacity):
    try:
        # Initialize the Application Auto Scaling client
        autoscaling = boto3.client('application-autoscaling', region_name='us-east-1')
        
        # Update scalable target for read capacity
        autoscaling.register_scalable_target(
            ServiceNamespace='dynamodb',
            ResourceId=f'table/{table_name}',
            ScalableDimension='dynamodb:table:ReadCapacityUnits',
            MinCapacity=min_read_capacity,
            MaxCapacity=max_read_capacity
        )
        
        # Update scalable target for write capacity
        autoscaling.register_scalable_target(
            ServiceNamespace='dynamodb',
            ResourceId=f'table/{table_name}',
            ScalableDimension='dynamodb:table:WriteCapacityUnits',
            MinCapacity=min_write_capacity,
            MaxCapacity=max_write_capacity
        )
        
        print(f"Auto-scaling settings for '{table_name}' updated successfully.")
        print(f"Read Capacity Range: {min_read_capacity} - {max_read_capacity}")
        print(f"Write Capacity Range: {min_write_capacity} - {max_write_capacity}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error updating auto-scaling settings for '{table_name}': {e}")

def revert_changes(table_name, original_read_capacity, original_write_capacity, original_min_read_capacity, original_max_read_capacity, original_min_write_capacity, original_max_write_capacity):
    print(f"Reverting changes for table '{table_name}'")
    # Revert auto-scaling settings
    update_scaling_policies(table_name, original_min_read_capacity, original_max_read_capacity, original_min_write_capacity, original_max_write_capacity)
    
    # Revert the table's provisioned throughput
    update_table_capacity(table_name, original_read_capacity, original_write_capacity)
    print(f"Reverted changes for table '{table_name}' successfully.")

def main():
    # Load configuration from env.json
    with open('/Users/ekp945/Documents/GitHub/Boto3_Local_testing/dynamodb.envprofile.dev.json', 'r') as file:
        config = json.load(file)
    
    for table_config in config['tables']:
        table_name = table_config['table_name']
        read_capacity = table_config['read_capacity']
        write_capacity = table_config['write_capacity']
        min_read_capacity = table_config['min_read_capacity']
        max_read_capacity = table_config['max_read_capacity']
        min_write_capacity = table_config['min_write_capacity']
        max_write_capacity = table_config['max_write_capacity']

        # Save original values to revert back later
        original_read_capacity = table_config['original_read_capacity']
        original_write_capacity = table_config['original_write_capacity']
        original_min_read_capacity = table_config['original_min_read_capacity']
        original_max_read_capacity = table_config['original_max_read_capacity']
        original_min_write_capacity = table_config['original_min_write_capacity']
        original_max_write_capacity = table_config['original_max_write_capacity']
        
        # Update auto-scaling settings
        update_scaling_policies(table_name, min_read_capacity, max_read_capacity, min_write_capacity, max_write_capacity)
        
        # Update the table's provisioned throughput
        update_table_capacity(table_name, read_capacity, write_capacity)
        
        # Schedule reversion of changes after 60 minutes (3600 seconds)
        threading.Timer(3600, revert_changes, args=(table_name, original_read_capacity, original_write_capacity, original_min_read_capacity, original_max_read_capacity, original_min_write_capacity, original_max_write_capacity)).start()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Points:
- **Threading**: Uses `threading.Timer` to schedule the reversion after 60 minutes.
- **Script Runtime**: The script does not need to run for the entire 60 minutes. It schedules the task and then can exit.
- **Revert Function**: This function will be called by the `threading.Timer` after 60 minutes to revert the changes.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Persistence**: If the script stops running for any reason before the 60 minutes is up, the revert changes won't occur. For a more robust solution, consider using a more persistent task scheduler or cron job.
- **Logging**: Add logging to capture when changes and reverts happen, especially if the script runs as a scheduled task.
