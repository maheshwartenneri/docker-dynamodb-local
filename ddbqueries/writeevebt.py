Based on the provided table schema and the code snippet for querying the transaction index, here is the JSON format for the DynamoDB query to get the transaction index:

### Query JSON Format for Get Transaction Index

```json
{
    "TableName": "dev_ledger_state_event_evidence",
    "IndexName": "event_by_transaction_id",
    "KeyConditionExpression": "contract_id = :contract_id AND transaction_id = :transaction_id",
    "ExpressionAttributeValues": {
        ":contract_id": {"S": "your_contract_id_value"},
        ":transaction_id": {"S": "your_transaction_id_value"}
    },
    "ProjectionExpression": "contract_id, transaction_id, SK, primary_event_hash",
    "Limit": 1
}
```

### Explanation:

- **TableName**: The name of the DynamoDB table.
- **IndexName**: The name of the local secondary index to query.
- **KeyConditionExpression**: The condition to query the index, matching both the partition key (`contract_id`) and the sort key (`transaction_id`).
- **ExpressionAttributeValues**: The actual values for the partition key and sort key to use in the query.
- **ProjectionExpression**: The attributes to retrieve from the query.
- **Limit**: Limits the query to return only one item, which will be the latest due to the descending order by sort key.

### How to Use

Replace `"your_contract_id_value"` and `"your_transaction_id_value"` with the actual values you want to query. Here is an example with hypothetical values:

```json
{
    "TableName": "dev_ledger_state_event_evidence",
    "IndexName": "event_by_transaction_id",
    "KeyConditionExpression": "contract_id = :contract_id AND transaction_id = :transaction_id",
    "ExpressionAttributeValues": {
        ":contract_id": {"S": "example_contract_id"},
        ":transaction_id": {"S": "example_transaction_id"}
    },
    "ProjectionExpression": "contract_id, transaction_id, SK, primary_event_hash",
    "Limit": 1
}
```

You can use this JSON format in your DynamoDB query request to get the transaction index. If you need further assistance or additional information, please let me know!
